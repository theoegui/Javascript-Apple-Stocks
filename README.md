Buy Low and Sell High Data Structures 
Writing programming interview questions hasn't made me rich. Maybe trading Apple stocks will.

Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:

The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.

Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

For example:

  var stockPricesYesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9];

getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday);
// returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).

function getMaxProfit( stockPricesYesterday ) {

	var MaxProfit=0;
	var Sell = 0;
	var potentialProfit=0;
	var laterPrice = 0;
	var ealierPrice = 0;

	// intilazation, condition, updated data 

	for ( var Buy = 0; Buy < stockPricesYesterday.length; Buy++ ) {
		var ealierPrice = stockPricesYesterday[ Buy ];

		for ( var Sell = Buy+1; Sell < stockPricesYesterday.length; Sell++ ) {
			var laterPrice = stockPricesYesterday[ Sell ];
			var potentialProfit = laterPrice - ealierPrice;
			var MaxProfit = Math.max( MaxProfit, potentialProfit );
		}
	}

	return MaxProfit;
}

actualProfit = getMaxProfit( [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9] );
console.log( actualProfit );
